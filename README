Quick start
===========

DiacriticsFu::escape("éphémère")
=> "ephemere"

DiacriticsFu::escape("räksmörgås")
=> "raksmorgas"

What?
=====

A small library to remove accents from a string. Relies on ActiveSupport.

Created because I needed a simple way to remove most diacritics from French sentences, while generating slugs (url) for a CMS (either Mephisto or ComatoseCMS).

Nb: this approach is not the fastest way to achieve this. It's good enough for me though.

You can run the spec against the latest available ActiveSupport using "rake spec".

To run the tests against all installed ActiveSupport versions, use "rake spec_multi"
