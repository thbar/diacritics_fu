Quick start
===========

DiacriticsFu::escape("éphémère")
=> "ephemere"

DiacriticsFu::escape("räksmörgås")
=> "raksmorgas"

What?
=====

A small library to remove accents from a string. Relies on ActiveSupport::Multibyte::Handlers::UTF8Handler (Rails).

Created because I needed a simple way to remove most diacritics from French sentences, while generating slugs (url) for a CMS (either Mephisto or ComatoseCMS).

Nb: this approach is not the fastest way to achieve this. It's good enough for me though.

The library is not packaged (either like a gem, or a plugin, that is). Just drop diacritics_fu.rb in your /lib folder.

TODO
====

This Git commit http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/22f75d539dca7b6f33cbf86e4e9d1944bb22731f indicates that the gem won't be able to work in future versions of rails => fix this.
